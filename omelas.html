                <li>"The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas" is a short dystopian story that prompts the reader to consider the ethical dilemma of living in a utopia at the cost of one individual's great suffering.</li>
                <li>The narrator structures the story in a way that it first prompts the reader to consider a utopia, before presenting its high price.</li>
                <li>The final two choices in this story reflect the real-world mindsets around the acceptance of suffering.</li>
                <li>The title makes it clear that the mroe interesting and puzzling choice (at least, in the perspective of the narrator) is to walk away from Omelas.</li>
                <li>The author uses this story to make a statement about the lack of gult surrounding violent atrocities due to being able to ignore it.</li>
                <li>Walking away from Omelas is a sign of protest against the acceptance of a utopia despite a high price.</li>
                <li>This work is a significant piece of literature that provokes readers to consider the real-life equivalents of this moral dilemma.</li>
                <li>In the world of computing and big data, how can we apply the morals of this story?</li>
                <li>What are some high prices to pay in the name of computing or scientific advancement? Are they worth it? Are they truly helping humanity?</li>
                <li>Is a significant price still worth it when it <i>is</i> in the name of helping humanity?</li>
